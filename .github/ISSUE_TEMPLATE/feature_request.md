Remember, to best support collaboration among USSs, there are two key tenets to the InterUSS Platform:
1. The InterUSS Platform is focused on facilitating communication amongst actively operating USSs.
2. No details about UAS operations are stored or processed on the InterUSS Platform. 

Regardless of the new features and changes brought to the platform via the open source process, these two tenets must be enforced to ensure protection of operator and consumer privacy and ensure the competition between USSs for drone services remains intact.
